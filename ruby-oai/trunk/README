DESCRIPTION

ruby-oai is a Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) 
client library for Ruby. If you're not familiar with OAI-PMH it is the 
most used protocol for sharing metadata between digital library repositories.

The OAI-PMH spec defines six verbs (Identify, ListIdentifiers, ListRecords, 
GetRecords, ListSets, ListMetadataFormat) which translate into methods you 
can call on a OAI::Client object.

SYNOPSIS

  # do a ListRecords request and print out the REXML::Element objects
  # for each record

  client = OAI::Client.new 'http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi'
  for record in client.list_records 
    puts record.metadata
  end

ruby-oai
--------

DESCRIPTION

ruby-oai is a Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) 
client library for Ruby. If you're not familiar with OAI-PMH it is the 
most used protocol for sharing metadata between digital library repositories.

The OAI-PMH spec defines six verbs (Identify, ListIdentifiers, ListRecords, 
GetRecords, ListSets, ListMetadataFormat) which translate into methods you 
can call on a OAI::Client object.

SYNOPSIS

  # do a ListRecords request and print out the REXML::Element objects
  # for each record

  client = OAI::Client.new 'http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi'
  for record in client.list_records 
    puts record.metadata
  end

HIGH PERFORMANCE

If you want to supercharge this api install libxml-ruby >= 0.3.8 and use the 
:parser option when you construct your OAI::Client.

INSTALLATION

Normally the best way to install oai is from rubyforge using the gem
command line tool:

  % gem install oai

If you're reading this you've presumably got the tarball or zip distribution.
So you'll need to:

  % rake package
  % gem install pkg/oai-x.y.z.gem 

Where x.y.z is the version of the gem that was generated.
